## [Project 1: Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/%20Car%20Price%20Prediction%20-%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will predict car prices and explore the methods we use to interpret and evaluate the results of our linear regression model.
- Assess the data.
- Build a basic linear regression model using a few selected features and run the model summary.
- Build a full linear regression model using a full range of features available.
- Plot a correlation matrix and perform feature engineering by reducing the number of independent variables we have.
- Perform one-hot Encoding on categorical variables.
- Split data into train and test sets, fit the model to training data and perform test set predictions.
- Print the summary output of the model, select variables that are statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), and retrain the model.
- Scale our independent variables and fit the model with our standardized data.
- Evaluate the Linear Regression model.

## [Project 2: Predicting Credit Card Approval - Classification Model: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Credit%20Card%20Approval%20-%20Classification.ipynb)

Build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques.
- First, we will start by loading and viewing the dataset.
- We will see that the dataset has a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features, contains values from different ranges, and has several missing entries.
- We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model can make good predictions.
- After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
- Finally, we will build a machine learning model that predicts if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.

## [Project 3: Google Play Store Apps and Reviews: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Google%20Play%20Store%20apps%20and%20reviews.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will comprehensively analyze the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights into the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

## [Project 4: A Visual History Of Nobel Price Winners: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/A%20visual%20History%20of%20Nobel%20Price%20Winners.ipynb)

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis and draw insights from the Nobel prize winners' dataset from 1901 to 2016.

## [Project 5: Analyze International Debt Statistics - SQL: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. We are going to find the answers to questions like:
- What is the total debt owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt, and what is the amount?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## [Project 6: Analyze NYC Public School Test Results Score - SQL: Project Overview](https://github.com/Annet-Chebukati/Annet_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20NYC%20Public%20School%20Test%20Result%20Scores.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will analyze data on SATs across public schools in New York City.
